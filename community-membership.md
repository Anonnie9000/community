## How to become a reviewer

Requirements to become a _code_ reviewer for a Special Interest Group (SIG):

* 6+ contributions successfully submitted to O3DE
* 100+ lines of code changed across all contributions submitted to O3DE
* 2+ O3DE Reviewers or Maintainers that support promotion from Contributor to Reviewer

Requierments to become a _docs_ reviewer for a SIG:

* 6+ documentation contributions submitted to o3de.org or O3DE
* 2+ D&C SIG Reviewers or Maintainers that support promotion, _or_ 1 D&C SIG Reviewer or Maintainer and 1 Maintainer from another SIG.

Docs does _not_ have a "lines of code" or "size of contribution" requirement. Promotions which are rejected will include a concrete requirement for additional contributions that would give the experience required to promote to reviewer.

The specialized D&C SIG role of _Documentation Technical Reviewer_ requires:

* Being a Reviewer or Maintainer for a SIG governing the appropriate tech
* The nomination of 2+ of the appropriate SIG's Reviewers or Maintainers.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Contributor to Reviewer. To do this, an issue should be created on the SIG's repo for the supportive Reviewers and Maintainers to comment and add their support. For example, to nominate a reviewer on behalf of sig-content, an Issue should be created in the [sig-content repository](https://github.com/o3de/sig-content/issues/new/choose).

Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Pull Request needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting.  The nominee should plan to attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve.
Nomination Pull Requests that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

Requirements to continue to be a Reviewer:

* 4+ Pull Requests reviewed per month

Requirements to continue to be a Documentation Techncial Reviewer:

* You serve in the regular tech reviewer rotation and respond to requests in a timely fashion.

If a Reviewer fails to meet the requirements, they will be given a 1 month grace period.  After the 2nd month, if they haven't returned to the required number of reviews, they will be returned to Contributor status.
