# Community Membership

Welcome to the Open 3D Engine! To learn more about contributing to the [O3DE code repo](README.md), check out the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/o3de/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The [O3DE community repo](https://github.com/o3de/community) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

To contribute, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. 

## Contributing to Open 3D Engine

Everyone is invited and welcome to contribute to Open 3D Engine by filing issues, pull requests, asking questions, participating in discussions and feature reviews, and engaging with _any_ public work. All you need to do is agree to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), ensure that your contribution is valid under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://www.dita-ot.org/dco) and sign your commits. Discussion requires no such agreement.

For contributors who are interested in working more in-depth on features or writing specifications, providing specific content types like videos or blogs, or managing groups of work, contact the appropriate [O3DE Special Interest Group]() to find out about their process and how to meet any requirements for official contributions.

## Reviewers 

A *Reviewer* is a role where a contributor is responsible for reviewing Pull Requests on GitHub and providing appropriate feedback. Reviewers are expected to be kind, courteous, and fair to submitters to any Open 3D Foundation project. We have three types of Reviewers:

* *Code Reviewers*, responsible for reviewing source code submitted to repositories maintained by the Open 3D Foundation.
* *Documentation Reviewers*, responsible for reviewing items under the [Documentation & Community Special Interest Group charter](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community/blob/main/governance/charter.md).
* *Technical Reviewers*, code reviewers who also review documentation for technical accuracy.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Contributor to Reviewer. To do this, an issue should be created on the SIG's repo for the supportive Reviewers and Maintainers to comment and add their support. For example, to nominate a reviewer on behalf of sig-content, an Issue should be created in the [sig-content repository](https://github.com/o3de/sig-content/issues/new/choose).

Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Issue needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting. If possible, the nominee should attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve. Nomination Issues that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

### Becoming a code reviewer

Requirements to become a _code_ reviewer for a Special Interest Group (SIG):

* 6+ contributions successfully merged to O3DE
* 100+ lines of code changed across all contributions submitted to O3DE
* 2+ O3DE Reviewers or Maintainers that support promotion from Contributor to Reviewer

### Becoming a documentation reviewer

Requirements to become a _docs_ reviewer:

* 6+ documentation contributions merged to o3de.org or O3DE
* 2+ Documentation and Community (D&C) SIG Reviewers or Maintainers that support promotion, _or_ 1 D&C SIG Reviewer or Maintainer and 1 Maintainer from another SIG.

Docs does _not_ have a "lines of code" or "size of contribution" requirement. Promotions which are rejected will include a path for future acceptance,
and will be reconsidered after 4 weeks if the nominee wants.

### Becoming a documentation technical reviewer

Documentation also requires technical reviewers who are approved Reviewers or Maintainers for technology SIGs. Technical reviewers aren't required
to review writing - they review for technical accuracy only. 

The specialized D&C SIG role of _Documentation Technical Reviewer_ requires:

* Being a Reviewer or Maintainer for a SIG governing the appropriate technology.
* 2+ of the appropriate SIG's Reviewers or Maintainers who support the promotion.

### Keeping Reviewer status

Requirements to continue to be a Reviewer:

* 4+ Pull Requests reviewed per month

If a Reviewer fails to meet the requirements, they will be given a 1 month grace period.  After the 2nd month, if they haven't returned to the required number of reviews, they will be returned to Contributor status.

## Maintainers

A *Maintainer* role is an increased level of responsibility for a Reviewer. Maintainers aren't just responsible for performing review - they also have the ability to merge pull requests into the appropriate branch. Maintainers are high-quality Reviewers who take extra care when looking at a pull request, and are willing to trust the other Reviewers who approve work.

You must be nominated (self-nomination is allowed) for promotion from Reviewer to Maintainer. To do this, an issue should be created on the community repo for the supportive Maintainers to comment and add their support. Once you have the requisite support, the nomination Pull Request needs to be reviewed and approved during a SIG meeting.  The nominee should plan to attend and add it to the agenda for the SIG to review and, if appropriate, approve. Nomination Pull Requests that do not have the necessary support will be closed after 4 weeks of inactivity.

### Maintainer requirements

Requirements to become a maintainer for a Special Interest Group:

* Has been a Reviewer for 2+ months
* 8+ reviewed Pull Requests in the previous 2 months
* 200+ lines of code changed across all reviewed Pull Requests
* 2+ O3DE Maintainers that support the promotion from Reviewer to Maintainer

Becoming a maintainer of the Documentation & Community SIG doesn't include the lines-of-code requirement, although large-impact reviews will be considered.

### Keeping Maintainer status

Requirements to continue to be a Maintainer:

* 8+ Pull Requests reviewed per month

If a Maintainer fails to meet the requirements, they will be given a 1 month grace period to get back to the required number of Pull Requests per month.  After the 2nd month, if they haven't returned to the required number of reviews, they will be returned to Reviewer status.
